\section{Average Classification Loss}

Define the loss and the problem

Derive the update rule


Theorem 1: the expected loss is less than the average loss

Theorem 2: 1-AUC is bounded 

Theorem 3: Show that classification is correct and $\vxp >0$ while $\vxn < 0$ after the update - this is not correct since we are balancing with $w_t$ from the former step.
This would have been correct if we would have possed this is a feasibility problem (perceptron style).
