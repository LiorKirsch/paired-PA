Define the new problem

Derive update rules using DCA

Derive update rules by calling PA sequentially 

Theorem 4: convergence of DCA

Theorem 5: classification errors --> number of mistakes

Theorem 6: Show that classification is correct and $ w x+ >0$ while $w x- < 0$ after the update

Theorem 7: from Theorem 5 it follows that 1-AUC is bounded
