\section{Calibrated Multilabel Classification and Ranking}

Calibrated separation ranking loss was proposed by \cite{GuoShuurmans11}

We are interested in the case where we have more than 2 classses and these classes are unbalanced. For this multliclass scenario we follow the $mutliclass AUC$ suggested by ... 
We define $AUC_{all \; pairs}$ by:
\[
	AUC_{all \; pairs} = \frac{1}{K} \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}  \frac{1}{K-1}\sum\limits_{l \neq k} (AUC_{w^k}(C^k, C^l)) 
\]
Where $C_i$ denote all the samples from class $i$, and $AUC_{w^k}(C^k, C^l)$ is the AUC performed on the samples from the $k$ class and samples from the $l$ class using the classifier $ \vw^k $ train using the samples from the k class as positivies.
\[
1 - AUC_{all \; pairs} \leq \frac{1}{K} ( \sum\limits_{k=1}^{K} E(M_{w^k}(C^k)) + \frac{1}{k-1} ( \sum\limits_{l \neq k}  E(M_{w^k}(C^l)) )
\]
This suggest that at time $t$ to train our classifier $\vw^k $ we need to present to it a positive sample from the $k$ class and average negative step from the other K-1 classes.\\
\\
\[
  \vw^k_t = \vw^k_{t-1} + \alpha^k_t \vx^k_t - \frac{1}{k-1}\sum\limits_{l \neq k} \alpha^l_t \vx^l_t
\]


The update rule is derivied using $\mathcal{J} = \{ i | 0 \leq l_{w_t}(\vx_i, y_i) \}$, we choose to update only the dual variables from the samples that we failed to be classified using the required margin.

\[ \delta = max(L_b   , min(U_b , \frac{|\mathcal{J}| - \vw_t^T \sum\limits_{j \in \mathcal{J}} {\vx_j y_j}   }{|| \sum\limits_{j \in \mathcal{J} }{\vx_j y_j} ||^2 }  ) )
\]

Theorem 8: correct multilabels are above the incorrect set of labels
