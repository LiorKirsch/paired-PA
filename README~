paired_PA_main 
	- generates a random vector w 
	- generates random samples and get their labels using w
	- reverses some of the labels
	- causes the data to be unbalanced

onlineClassifiers 
	- contains svm using DCA
	- DCA where we always update a positive and a negative
	- perceptron 

passive_aggressive_varients
	- PA
	- PA AUC where the input is (x_pos - x_neg)
	- PA with project constrains

multi_step_passive_aggressive
	- pairedPA_exact where we solve an exact solution for each pair
	- dca_with_memory which solves DCA with an memory of a weight vector
	- pairedPA_one loss
